		COVID-19 has affected our daily lives in an unprecedented range of ways, from physical distancing to travel bans. But the pandemic is also influencing our planet. Air pollution levels have dropped significantly since measures such as quarantines and shutdowns were put in place to contain COVID-19. Around the world, levels of harmful pollutants like NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), CO (carbon monoxide), SO2 (sulfur dioxide) and PM2.5 (small particulate matter) have plummeted—at least, while shutdowns continue. But environmental benefits will only be temporary unless we implement long-term measures to cut emissions. It’s a stark reminder that air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, is a global threat that can’t be forgotten, even in these challenging times.

	<h1>Nitrogen dioxide</h1>
	<p>

Air pollution decreased by 30%.
Nitrogen dioxide, primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation, can be used as an indicator of changes in human activity. The images below show average concentrations of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide as measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Aura satellite, as processed by a team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. The left image in the slider shows the average concentration in March of 2015-19, while the right image in the slider shows the average concentration measured in March of this year.

	<h1>Carbon Monoxide</h1>
	<p>
	Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a harmful pollutant that is released when something is burned, such as in the combustion of fossil fuels, the primary source, or biomass burning. Outdoor levels are rarely high enough to cause issues; when they do reach dangerous levels, however, they can be of concern to people with certain types of heart disease. 
CO is a poisonous, odorless, and colorless gas. It is produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning, and the oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons. 
CO is not a direct greenhouse gas; however CO and other pollutants can affect tropospheric ozone, carbon dioxide, and methane. Thus, CO can have an indirect effect on climate.
 CO is a relatively short-lived species, with a lifetime on the order of two months in the troposphere.  Because of its relatively short lifetime, CO is not well-mixed, and thus it is often used as a tracer to track polluted air masses in the troposphere.
